# Editing vault details
{: #edit-vaults}

You can edit your vaults in {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} with the UI, or programmatically with the {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} API. With a vault, you cannot only create key templates, create managed keys, or add keystores, but also manage resources that are contained in the vault.
{: shortdesc}


## Editing vault details with the UI
{: #edit-vaults-ui}
{: ui}

To edit vault details by using the UI, complete the following steps:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Click **Vaults** from the navigation to view all the available vaults.
3. Click the vault that you want to edit. The Details side panel is displayed.
4. Click **Edit** to update the **Vault name** and **Description**. 
  
    The vault name must be of 1 to 100 characters in length. The characters can be letters (case-sensitive), digits (0-9), or symbols (#@!$%\â€™_-).
  
5. Click **Save** to save the property changes.

6. The key templates, keys, and keystores that are assigned to this vault are displayed in tables. 
7.  Optionally, you can add additional key templates to the vault by clicking **Create key template** under **Key templates**, add keys by clicking **Create key** under **Managed Keys**, or add keystores by clicking **Add keystores** under **Keystores**.



## Editing vault details with the API
{: #edit-vaults-api}
{: api}

To edit a vault through the API, follow these steps:

1. [Retrieve your service and authentication credentials to work with vaults in the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-set-up-uko-api).
   
2. Edit a vault by making a `PATCH` call to the following endpoint.

    {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} is continuously replacing port-based API endpoints with instance-based API endpoints. For example, for public {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} endpoint URLs, the format is changed from `uko.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>` to `<instance_ID>.uko.<region>.hs-crypto.appdomain.cloud`. For a complete list of the endpoint URL schemes and more information about which regions now support instance-based endpoint URLs, see [Instance-based endpoints](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-regions#new-service-endpoints). Note that, for any new service instances created after the dates specified in the table, only instance-based endpoint URLs can be applied. No impact to existing service instances is expected, as the current port-based endpoint scheme stays intact for the time being. However, it is suggested to use the new instance-based scheme wherever possible especially for new projects.
    {: note}
    
    ```
    https://<instance_ID>.uko.<region>.hs-crypto.appdomain.cloud/api/v4/vaults/<vault_id>
    
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace `<vault_id>` with the ID of your vault.

    For detailed instructions and code examples about using the API method, check out the [{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} API reference doc](/apidocs/uko#update-vault){: external}.
