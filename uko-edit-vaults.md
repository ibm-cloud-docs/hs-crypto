# Editing vault details
{: #edit-vaults}

You can edit your vaults in {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, or programmatically with the {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} API. With a vault, you cannot only create key templates, create managed keys, or add keystores, but also manage resources that are contained in the vault.

## Editing vault details with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console
{: #edit-vaults-ui}
{: ui}

To edit vault details by using the console, complete the following steps:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Click **Vaults** from the navigation to view all the available vaults.
3. Click the vault that you want to edit. The Details side panel is displayed.
4. Click **Edit** to update the **Vault name** and **Description**. 
  
    The vault name must be of 1 to 100 characters in length. The characters can be letters (case-sensitive), digits (0-9), or symbols (#@!$%\â€™_-).
  
5. Click **Save** to save the property changes.

6. The key templates, keys, and keystores that are assigned to this vault are displayed in tables. 
7.  Optionally, you can add additional key templates to the vault by clicking **Create key template** under **Key templates**, add keys by clicking **Create key** under **Managed Keys**, or add keystores by clicking **Add keystores** under **Keystores**.



## Editing vault details with the API
{: #edit-vaults-api}
{: api}

To edit a vault through the API, follow these steps:

1. [Retrieve your service and authentication credentials to work with vaults in the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-set-up-uko-api).
   
2. Edit a vault by making a `PATCH` call to the following endpoint.

    ```
    https://uko.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v4/vaults/<vault_id>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace `<vault_id>` with the ID of your vault.

    For detailed instructions and code examples about using the API method, check out the [{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} API reference doc](/apidocs/uko#update-vault){: external}.
