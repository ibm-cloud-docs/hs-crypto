# Rotating master keys by using key part files
{: #rotate-master-key-cli-key-part}

You need to rotate the master key for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance regularly to meet industry standards and cryptographic best practices. To rotate the master key using master key part files on your local workstation, follow these steps.
{: shortdesc}

When the master key is being rotated, you can still perform some KMS key actions such as listing keys, retrieving key metadata, or deleting keys, but you cannot create or rotate keys. You cannot call either the PKCS #11 API or GREP11 API during the master key rotation. 
{: note}


Rotating the master key reencrypts the keys in key storage using the new master key value.Â After the keys in key storage are reencrypted, the value in the new master key register is promoted to the current master key register. Before you start rotating the master key, you need to do the following steps:


- Understand how a master key is rotated [for the standard plan](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-master-key-rotation-intro) or [for the {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} plan](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-uko-master-key-rotation-intro).
- Assign the **Manager** service access role or the **crypto unit administrator** role to perform TKE CLI operations. For more information about the access management, see Managing user access [for the standard plan](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-manage-access) or [for the {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} plan](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-uko-manage-access).
- Configure all crypto units in the service instance the same.


Key objects in the in-memory keystore are not automatically rotated after the master key rotation. If PKCS #11 keystores are enabled in your service instance, you need to restart all active PKCS #11 applications to clear the in-memory keystore after the master key rotation is complete. For more information, see [PKCS #11 implementation components](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-uko-pkcs11-intro#uko-pkcs11-components).

## Before you begin
{: #rotate-master-key-cli-key-part-prerequisites}

Before you start, make sure to do the following steps:

1. Complete the [steps to set up the IBM Cloud CLI with TKE plug-in](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm-prerequisite).
2. Check and make sure that the current master key register is in `Valid` state with [the current master key loaded](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm#load-master-keys), the new master key register is empty, and the crypto units of the service instance are not in imprint mode by running the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud tke cryptounit-compare
    ```
    {: pre}

3. The new master key parts are prepared for rotation. For more information about how to create a new master key part, see [Create a set of master key parts to use](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm#step4-create-master-key).

## Rotating master keys by using key part files
{: #rotate-master-key-cli-key-part-steps}
{: help}
{: support}

To rotate the master key by using key part files on your workstation, follow these steps:

1. Load the new master key parts to the new master key register with the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud tke cryptounit-mk-load
    ```
    {: pre}

    To load a master key register, all master key part files and signature key files to be used must be present on a common workstation. If the files were created on separate workstations, make sure that the file names are different to avoid collision. The master key part file owners and signature key file owners need to enter the file passwords when the master key register is loaded on the common workstation.

    A list of the master key parts that are found on the workstation is displayed.

    When prompted, enter the master key parts to be loaded into the new master key register, the password for the signature key file to be used, and password for each selected key part file sequentially.

    The new master key is now in `Full uncommitted` state in the new master key register.

    To load a new master key, you need to enter at least two master key parts. Make sure that at least one master key part is not used for the current master key. Otherwise, the same master key is generated and you are not able to load it to the new master key register.
    {: important}

2. Commit the new master key with the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud tke cryptounit-mk-commit
    ```
    {: pre}

    When prompted, enter the passwords for the signature key files to be used. A full set of signatures is required to enforce quorum authentication. 

    The new master key is now in `Full committed` state in the new master key register.

3. If you have any encryption keys that are encrypted with the current master key using the GREP11 API and are not stored in the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} keystore, call the [RewrapKeyBlob GREP11 API](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grep11-api-ref#grep11-rewrapKeyBlob) to reencrypt the keys with the new master key.

    Make sure to perform this step before you rotate the master key. Otherwise, your keys that are encrypted with the current master key cannot be reencrypted and used.
    {: important}

    For an introduction to the GREP11 API, see [Introducing EP11 over gRPC](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grep11-intro). You can also find code examples that are written in [Golang](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/hpcs-grep11-go){: external} and [JavaScript](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/hpcs-grep11-js) on the GREP11 API usage.

4. Rotate the current master key with the new master key and reencrypt the keys that are managed by performing the following steps:

    1. Start master key rotation by running the following command:

        ```
        ibmcloud tke cryptounit-mk-rotate
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. When prompted, type `y` to proceed with the pre-check.

        The following settings are checked:
        - Only one service instance is selected and all crypto units from that service instance are select.
        - All selected crypto units have left imprint mode and have the same signature threshold.
        - The selected administrators match the administrators that are installed in the crypto units.
        - All crypto units have the new and current key registers configured correctly.

    3. To rotate the master key and activate the new master key, enter the password for the signature key file to be used when prompted.

    A success message is displayed when the master key rotation is completed. It might take approximately 60 seconds to reencrypt 3000 keys. 

    The new master key is now in `Valid` state in the current master key register. Check out master key rotation [for the standard plan](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-master-key-rotation-intro) or [for the {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} plan](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-uko-master-key-rotation-intro) for more information about how the key states change.

Your encryption keys are now protected by the new master key.

If an error occurs during master key rotation, see [Why can't I rotate master keys by using key part files](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-troubleshoot-master-key-rotation-key-part-files).
