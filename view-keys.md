# Viewing a list of root keys or standard keys
{: #view-keys}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} provides a centralized system to view, manage, and audit your encryption keys. Audit your keys and access restrictions to keys to ensure the security of your resources.
{: shortdesc}

Audit your key configuration regularly:

- Examine when keys were created and determine whether it's time to rotate the key.
- [Monitor API calls to {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} with {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}}](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-at-events).
- Inspect which users have access to keys and if the level of access is appropriate.

For more information about auditing access to your resources, see [Managing user access](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-manage-access).

## Viewing root keys or standard keys with the console
{: #view-key-gui}

If you prefer to inspect the keys in your service by using a graphical interface, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

[After you create or import your existing keys into the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-root-keys), complete the following steps to view your keys.

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.
3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
4. On the **KMS keys** page, browse the general characteristics of your keys in the **Keys** table:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Column</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      <tr>
        <td>ID</td>
        <td>A unique key ID that was assigned to your key by the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} service. You can use the ID value to make calls to the service with the [{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key management API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/hs-crypto).</td>

        <td>The date that an authorization for deletion expires for the key. If this date passes, the authorization is no longer valid. If `False` is the value for the `Dual authorization enabled` or `Set for deletion` column of the key, the `Deletion expiration` column is left empty.</td>

    Not seeing the full list of keys that are stored in your service instance?
    Verify with your administrator that you are assigned the correct role for
    the applicable service instance or individual key. For more information
    about roles, see

## Viewing root keys or standard keys with the key management API
{: #view-key-api}

You can retrieve the contents of your keys by using the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key management API.

### Retrieving a list of your root keys or standard keys
{: #retrieve-keys-api}

For a high-level view, you can browse your root keys or standard keys that are managed in your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} by making a `GET` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your service and authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-set-up-kms-api).

2. View general characteristics about your keys by running the following cURL command.

    ```sh
    curl -X GET \
    "https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys" \
    -H 'accept: application/vnd.ibm.collection+json' \

    -H 'x-kms-key-ring: <key_ring_ID>' \
    -H 'correlation-id: <correlation_ID>' \
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following table.

    By default, `GET api/v2/keys` returns your first 200 keys, but you can adjust this limit by using the `limit` parameter at query time. To learn more about `limit` and `offset`, see
    [Retrieving a subset of keys](#retrieve-subset-keys-api).

    Not seeing the full list of keys? You might need to use `limit` and `offset`
    or check with your administrator to ensure you're assigned the correct level
    access to keys in your instance. To learn more, see
    [Unable to view or list keys](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-troubleshoot-unable-to-list-keys-api).
    {: tip}

### Retrieving a subset of keys
{: #retrieve-subset-keys-api}

By specifying the `limit` and `offset` parameters at query time, you can retrieve a subset of your keys, starting with the `offset` value that you specify.

For example, you might have 3000 total keys that are stored in your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} service instance, but you want to retrieve keys 200 - 300 when you make a `GET /keys` request.

You can use the following example request to retrieve a different set of keys.

```cURL
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys?offset=<offset>&limit=<limit>' \
  -H 'accept: application/vnd.ibm.collection+json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>' \
  -H 'bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>'
```
{: codeblock}

Replace the `limit` and `offset` variables in your request according to the
following table.

<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <varname>offset</varname>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
        The number of keys to skip.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, if you have 50 keys in your instance, and you want to list keys 26 - 50, use <code>../keys?offset=25</code>. You can also pair <code>offset</code> with <code>limit</code> to page through your available resources.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <varname>limit</varname>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
        The number of keys to retrieve.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, if you have 100 keys in your instance, and you want to list only 10 keys, use <code>../keys?limit=10</code>. The maximum value for <code>limit</code> is 5000.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <caption>
    Table 2. Describes the <code>limit</code> and <code>offset</code> variables
    </caption>
</table>


For usage notes, check out the following examples for setting your `limit` and `offset` query parameters.

<table>
    <tr>
    <th>URL</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>.../keys</code></td>
    <td>Lists all of your available resources, up to the first 2000 keys.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>.../keys?limit=10</code></td>
    <td>Lists the first 10 keys.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>.../keys?offset=25&limit=50</code></td>
    <td>Lists keys 26 - 75.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>.../keys?offset=3000&limit=50</code></td>
    <td>Lists keys 3001 - 3050.</td>
    </tr>
    <caption>Table 3. Provides usage notes for the limit and offset query parameters</caption>
</table>

Offset is the location of a particular key in a data set. The `offset` value is zero-based, which means that the 10th encryption key in a data set is at offset 9.
{: tip}

### Retrieving keys by state
{: #filter-keys-state-api}

By specifying the `state` parameter at query time, you can retrieve keys that are in the states that you specify.

For example, you might have keys in your service instance that are in the active, suspended, and destroyed states, but you only want to retrieve keys in the active state when you make a `GET /keys` request.

The state query parameter takes in a list of integers 0 - 5 delimited by commas with no whitespace or trailing commas. Valid states are based on NIST SP 800-57. For more information about key states, see [Key states and transitions](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-key-states).
{: note}

You can use the following example request to retrieve a different set of keys.

```cURL
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys?state=<state_integers>' \
  -H 'accept: application/vnd.ibm.collection+json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>' \
  -H 'bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>'
```
{: codeblock}

Replace the `state` variable in your request according to the following table.

<table>
    <tr>
    <th>Variable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
      <varname>state</varname>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        The states of the keys to be retrieved. States are integers and
        correspond to the Pre-activation = 0, Active = 1, Suspended = 2,
        Deactivated = 3, and Destroyed = 5 values.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you want to only list keys in the active state in your
        service instance, use <code>../keys?state=1</code>. You can also pair
        <code>state</code> with<code>offset</code> with <code>limit</code> to
        page through your available resources.
      </p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <caption>

parameter.

    <th>Description</th>

    <tr>
