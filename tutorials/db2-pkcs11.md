# Tutorial: Using {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 for IBM Db2 native encryption
{: #tutorial-db2-pkcs11}

IBM Db2Â® native encryption protects key database files and database backup images from inappropriate access while they are stored on external storage media. The database system automatically encrypts and decrypts data when it is used by authorized users and applications. Typically, database users do not need to be aware of native encryption and database client applications do not need to be adapted specifically.
{: shortdesc}

Db2 native encryption uses a two-tiered key hierarchy: Data is encrypted with a data encryption key (DEK). The DEK is encrypted with a master key and is stored in encrypted form with the database or the backup image. A unique DEK is generated by Db2 for each encrypted database and for each encrypted backup.

A master key is used to encrypt a DEK. Each encrypted database is associated with one master key at one time.

One important question when you plan for Db2 native encryption is where you keep the master key and how you secure it.

## Objectives
{: #tutorial-db2-objectives}

This tutorial shows how you can keep complete and exclusive control of your master keys by storing them in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. For this purpose, you need to use the PKCS #11 integration feature of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.

With this tutorial, you are going to implement the setup that is depicted in the following illustration.

![IBM Db2 default encryption with the standard PKCS #11 API](../images/pkcs_db2.svg "IBM Db2 default encryption with the standard PKCS #11 API"){: caption="Figure 1. IBM Db2 default encryption with the standard PKCS #11 API" caption-side="bottom"}

In this setup, Db2 is to call operations to manage the master keys on the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library. The {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library interacts with your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance, which provides the best of class technology for storing and managing your master keys.

## Before you begin
{: #tutorial-db2-prerequisites}

To complete this tutorial, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- [Sign up an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-signing_required_accounts#signing_required_accounts-cloud)
- [Provision a {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-provision)

## Task flow
{: #tutorial-db2-steps}

To complete this solution, let's walk through the following steps:

1. [Initialize your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](#tutorial-db2-initialize)
1. [Set up the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library](#tutorial-db2-pkcs11-setup)
1. [Set up Db2 and configure Db2 native encryption](#tutorial-db2-encrypt)

## Initialize your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance
{: #tutorial-db2-initialize}
{: step}

1. For this tutorial, you need to [initialize a {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance first](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm).

    Note down the ID of your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance and the EP11 endpoint address. You need this information for the subsequent steps.

2. [Setup the required PKCS #11 user types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-best-practice-pkcs11-access): Follow the instructions to setup the service IDs for the SO user and the normal user and create API keys for these service IDs. Note that the Anonymous user type which is mentioned in the instructions is not required for the subsequent steps.

3. Save the value of the API keys for the SO user and the normal user for subsequent steps.

## Set up the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library
{: #tutorial-db2-pkcs11-setup}
{: step}

### 1. Run the Db2 Community Edition container
{: #tutorial-db2-community-container}

1. Use the following command to run the Db2 Community Edition container:

    ```
    docker run -itd --name mydb --privileged=true -p 50000:50000 -e LICENSE=accept -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=password -e DBNAME=testdb ibmcom/db2
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Run the following command from a command line on your host system:

    ```
    docker exec -it --user root --workdir / mydb bash
    ```
    {: codeblock}

This shell is to be used to run the commands as `root` for the subsequent steps.

### 2. Create the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 configuration file
{: #tutorial-db2-config-setup}

Now, create a configuration file for the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 feature. The configuration file is named `grep11client.yaml`.

Adapt the following file template and name the file `grep11client.yaml`:

- Replace `<instance_id>` with the ID of your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance
- Replace `<EP11_endpoint_URL>` and `<EP11_endpoint_port_number>` with the respective parameters of the EP11 endpoint address of your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance

```yaml
iamcredentialtemplate: &defaultiamcredential
          enabled: true
          endpoint: "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com"
          # The Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) of your Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance.
          instance: "<instance_id>"

tokens:
  0:
    grep11connection:
      # The EP11 endpoint address starting from 'ep11'. For example: "ep11.us-south.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com"
      address: "<EP11_endpoint_URL>"
      port: "<EP11_endpoint_port_number>" # The EP11 endpoint port number
      tls:
        enabled: true # EP11 requires TLS connection.
        # Set it 'true' if you want to enable mutual TLS connections.
        # By default, set it 'false' because EP11 requires server-only authentication.
        mutual: false
        # 'cacert' is a full-path certificate file. In Linux with the 'ca-ca-certificates' package installed, this is normally not needed.
        cacert:
        # Specify the file path of the client certificate if you enable mutual TLS. Otherwise, keep it empty.
        certfile: 
        # Specify the file path of the client certificate private key if you enable mutual TLS. Otherwise, keep it empty.
        keyfile: 
    storage:
        # 'remotestore' needs to be enabled if you want to generate keys with the attribute CKA_TOKEN.
      remotestore:
        enabled: true
    users:
       # The Security Officer (SO) user
      0: # The index of the Security Officer (SO) user MUST be 0.
        # The name for the Security Officer (SO) user. For example: "Administrator":
        name: "Administrator"
        iamauth: *defaultiamcredential
      # The normal user
      1: # The index of the normal user MUST be 1.
        # The name for the normal user. For example: "Normal user":
        name: "Normal user"
        # The 128-bit UUID of the private keystore:
        tokenspaceID: "63b83625-8830-4223-86e8-0e7c58012daa"
        iamauth: *defaultiamcredential
      # The anonymous user
      # This example will not use the anonymous user, but includes the following section for illustration and for syntactical completeness.
      2: # The index of the anonymous user MUST be 2.
        # The name for the anonymous user. For example: "Anonymous":
        name: "Anonymous"
        # The 128-bit UUID of the public keystore:
        tokenspaceID: "ac5f8f38-1a26-468f-9a0b-7d6189012d0b"
        iamauth: *defaultiamcredential
logging:
  # Set the logging level.
  # The supported levels, in an increasing order of verboseness: 'panic', 'fatal', 'error', 'warning'/'warn', 'info', 'debug', 'trace'. The Default value is 'warning'.
  loglevel: "info"
  logpath: "/tmp/grep11client.log" # The full path of your logging file.
```
{: codeblock}

### 3. Install the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library
{: #tutorial-db2-install-library}

1. [Download the latest PKCS #11 library](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/hpcs-pkcs11/releases){: external}.

2. Copy the previously created configuration file `grep11client.yaml` and the PKCS #11 library `pkcs11-grep11-<platform>.so.<version>` into your Db2 container.

3. Run the following commands as `root` to install the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library in your Db2 setup.

    ```linux
    mkdir /etc/ep11client
    chmod a+rx /etc/ep11client/
    cp grep11client.yaml /etc/ep11client/grep11client.yaml
    chmod a+r /etc/ep11client/grep11client.yaml

    mkdir -p /pkcs11
    cp pkcs11-grep11-<platform>.so.<version> /pkcs11/pkcs11-grep11.so
    chmod -R a+rwx /pkcs11

    touch /tmp/grep11client.log
    chmod a+rw /tmp/grep11client.log
    ```
    {: codeblock}

### 4. Initialize the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library
{: #tutorial-db2-initialize-library}

1. Install the command-line utility OpenSC (pkcs11-tool) with the following command:

    ```
    yum install opensc
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Run the following command as `root` to initialize the library setup.

    ```
    pkcs11-tool --module=/pkcs11/pkcs11-grep11.so -I
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    This command prints information about the manufacturer and the library, for example:

    ```
    Cryptoki version 2.40
    Library          GREP11 PKCS11 client ...
    ```
    {: screen}

3. To initialize a token, run the following commands and replace `<so_user_api_key>` by the API key of the SO user that you created.

    ```
    pkcs11-tool  --module /pkcs11/pkcs11-grep11.so --init-token --label dbtoken --so-pin "<so_user_api_key>"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    This command prints the following status message, for example:

    ```
    Using slot 0 with a present token (0x0)
    Token successfully initialized
    ```
    {: screen}

## Set up Db2 native encryption
{: #tutorial-db2-encrypt}
{: step}

Now, let's set up Db2 native encryption. To do so, make sure that you have all database administrator privileges.

1. Create the file `/pkcs11/keystore.conf` with the following content:

    ```
    VERSION=1
    PRODUCT_NAME=Other
    ALLOW_KEY_INSERT_WITHOUT_KEYSTORE_BACKUP=true
    LIBRARY=/pkcs11/pkcs11-grep11.so
    SLOT_ID=0
    NEW_OBJECT_TYPE=PRIVATE
    KEYSTORE_STASH=/pkcs11/pkcs11_pw.sth
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Run the following commands as `root` to update ownership and permissions of file `/pkcs11/keystore.conf`:

    ```
    chown -R db2inst1:db2iadm1 /pkcs11/keystore.conf
    chmod ug+rw /pkcs11/keystore.conf
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3. To create a password stash file, run the following commands and replace <normal_user_api_key> by the API key of the normal user that you created.

    ```
    su - db2inst1
    db2credman -stash -password "<normal_user_api_key>" -to /pkcs11/pkcs11_pw.sth
    ```
    {: codeblock}

4. To update the Db2 configuration, run the following command as user `db2inst1`:

    ```
    db2 update dbm cfg using keystore_location /pkcs11/keystore.conf  keystore_type pkcs11
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5. To set the environment variable `DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE`, run the following commands as user `db2inst1` and restart DB2:

    ```
    db2 terminate
    db2stop
    export DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE=HMAC
    db2start
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    You need to specify the environment variable `DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE=HMAC` before you start Db2. If you use Db2 on Windows, you need to set the Db2 profile variable by using the following command:
    {: note}

    ```
    db2set -g DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE=HMAC
    ```
    {: codeblock}

6. To create an encrypted database, run the following commands:

    ```
    db2 create db cryptdb1 encrypt
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    This command prints the following information:

    ```
    DB20000I  The CREATE DATABASE command completed successfully.
    ```
    {: screen}

7. To test the encrypted database, run the following commands:

    ```
    db2 connect to cryptdb1
    db2 "create table test (id int not null, data varchar(100))"
    db2 "insert into test values (1, 'This is a secret text')"
    db2 "select * from test"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    This command prints the following information:

    ```
    ID          DATA
    ----------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          1 This is a secret text

    1 record(s) selected.
    ```
    {: screen}
