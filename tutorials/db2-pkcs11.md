# Using {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 for IBM Db2 native encryption
{: #tutorial-db2-pkcs11}

IBM Db2Â® native encryption protects key database files and database backup images from inappropriate access while they are stored on external storage media. The database system automatically encrypts and decrypts data when it is used by authorized users and applications. Typically, database users do not need to be aware of native encryption and database client applications do not need to be adapted specifically.
{: shortdesc}

Db2 native encryption uses a two-tiered key hierarchy: Data is encrypted with a data encryption key (DEK). The DEK is encrypted with a master key and is stored in encrypted form with the database or the backup image. A unique DEK is generated by Db2 for each encrypted database and for each encrypted backup.

A master key is used to encrypt a DEK. Each encrypted database is associated with one master key at one time.

One important question when you plan for Db2 native encryption is where you keep the master key and how you secure it.

## Objectives
{: #tutorial-db2-objectives}

This tutorial shows how you can keep complete and exclusive control of your master keys by storing them in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. For this purpose, you need to use the PKCS #11 integration feature of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.

With this tutorial, you are going to implement the setup that is depicted in the following illustration.

![IBM Db2 default encryption with the standard PKCS #11 API](../images/pkcs-db2.svg "IBM Db2 default encryption with the standard PKCS #11 API"){: caption="Figure 1. IBM Db2 default encryption with the standard PKCS #11 API" caption-side="bottom"}

In this setup, Db2 is to call operations to manage the master keys on the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library. The {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library interacts with your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance, which provides the best of class technology for storing and managing your master keys.

## Before you begin
{: #tutorial-db2-prerequisites}

To complete this tutorial, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- [Sign up an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](/docs/vmwaresolutions?topic=vmwaresolutions-signing_required_accounts#signing_required_accounts-cloud)
- [Provision a {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-provision)

## Task flow
{: #tutorial-db2-steps}

To complete this solution, let's walk through the following steps:

1. [Initialize your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](#tutorial-db2-initialize)
1. [Set up the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library](#tutorial-db2-pkcs11-setup)
1. [Set up Db2 and configure Db2 native encryption](#tutorial-db2-encrypt)

## Initialize your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance
{: #tutorial-db2-initialize}
{: step}

1. For this tutorial, you need to [initialize a {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance first](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm).

    Note down the ID of your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance and the EP11 endpoint address. You need this information for the subsequent steps.

2. Create a custom IAM role `Discover HPCS`. This role provides a very limited permission for discovering your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance, which is required by the PKCS #11 library. This role does not have permissions to use, create, or manage keys or EP11 keystores.
    1. From the UI, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**, and select **Roles**, and then click **Create**.
    2. Enter the name `Discover HPCS` for your role.
    3. Enter an ID for the role. This ID is used in the CRN, which is used when you assign access by using the API. The role ID must begin with a capital letter and use alphanumeric characters only; for example, `DiscoverHPCS`.
    4. Optional: Enter a succinct and helpful description that helps the users who are assigning access know what level of access that the role assignment gives a user. This description also shows in the UI when a user assigns access to the service.
    5. From the list of services, select **Hyper Protect Crypto Services**
    6. Select **Add** for the `hs-crypto.discovery.listservers` action, and then click **Create**.

3. Follow the instructions in [Setting up PKCS #11 API user types](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-best-practice-pkcs11-access) to set up the service IDs and API keys for the normal user and anonymous user. 

    Do not set up the SO user type that is mentioned in the instructions. Also, in contrast to the instructions, do not assign the anonymous user service ID the `Key operator` custom role, but assign the `Discover HPCS` custom role instead.
    {: note} 
    
    With this setup, the anonymous user has only very limited permissions on your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance and cannot use, create, or manage keys or EP11 keystores.

4. Save the value of the API keys for the normal user and the anonymous user for subsequent steps.

5. Follow the [instructions](/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-manage-ep11-keystores-ui#create-ep11-keystore-ui) to create a private EP11 keystore and note the keystore ID for subsequent steps.

## Set up the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library
{: #tutorial-db2-pkcs11-setup}
{: step}

### 1. Run the Db2 Community Edition container
{: #tutorial-db2-community-container}

1. Use the following command to run the Db2 Community Edition container:

    ```
    docker run -itd --name mydb --privileged=true -p 50000:50000 -e LICENSE=accept -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=password -e DBNAME=testdb ibmcom/db2
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Run the following command from a command line on your host system:

    ```
    docker exec -it --user root --workdir / mydb bash
    ```
    {: codeblock}

This shell is to be used to run the commands as `root` for the subsequent steps.

### 2. Create the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 configuration file
{: #tutorial-db2-config-setup}

Now, create a configuration file for the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 feature. The configuration file is named `grep11client.yaml`.

Adapt the following file template and name the file `grep11client.yaml`:

- Replace `<instance_id>` with the ID of your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance
- Replace `<EP11_endpoint_URL>` and `<EP11_endpoint_port_number>` with the respective parameters of the EP11 endpoint address of your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance
- Replace `<private_keystore_id>` with the ID of the private keystore you created previously
- Replace `<anonymous_user_api_key>` with the respective API key of the anonymous user

```yaml
iamcredentialtemplate: &defaultiamcredential
          enabled: true
          endpoint: "https://iam.cloud.ibm.com"
          # The Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) of your Hyper Protect Crypto Services instance.
          instance: "<instance_id>"

tokens:
  0:
    grep11connection:
      # The EP11 endpoint address starting from 'ep11'. For example: "ep11.us-south.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com"
      address: "<EP11_endpoint_URL>"
      port: "<EP11_endpoint_port_number>" # The EP11 endpoint port number
      tls:
        enabled: true # EP11 requires TLS connection.
        mutual: false
    storage:
      remotestore:
        enabled: true
    users:
       # The Security Officer (SO) user
      0: # The index of the Security Officer (SO) user MUST be 0.
        # The name for the Security Officer (SO) user. For example: "Administrator":
        name: "Administrator"
        iamauth: *defaultiamcredential
      # The normal user
      1: # The index of the normal user MUST be 1.
        # The name for the normal user. For example: "Normal user":
        name: "Normal user"
        # The 128-bit UUID of the private keystore which you created previously
        tokenspaceID: "<private_keystore_id>"
        iamauth: *defaultiamcredential
      # The anonymous user
      2: # The index of the anonymous user MUST be 2.
        # The name for the anonymous user. For example: "Anonymous":
        name: "Anonymous"
        # The public keystore will not be used with this setup.
        # Specify an arbitrary 128-bit UUID below, e.g.:
        tokenspaceID: "12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890AB"
        iamauth:
          <<: *defaultiamcredential
          # Provide the API key for the Anonymous user.
          apikey: "<anonymous_user_api_key>"
logging:
  # Set the logging level.
  # The supported levels, in an increasing order of verboseness: 'panic', 'fatal', 'error', 'warning'/'warn', 'info', 'debug', 'trace'. The Default value is 'warning'.
  loglevel: "info"
  logpath: "/tmp/grep11client.log" # The full path of your logging file.
```
{: codeblock}

### 3. Install the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library
{: #tutorial-db2-install-library}

1. [Download the latest PKCS #11 library](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/hpcs-pkcs11/releases){: external}.

2. Copy the previously created configuration file `grep11client.yaml` and the PKCS #11 library `pkcs11-grep11-<platform>.so.<version>` into your Db2 container.

3. Run the following commands as `root` to install the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} PKCS #11 library in your Db2 setup.

    ```linux
    mkdir /etc/ep11client
    chmod a+rx /etc/ep11client/
    cp grep11client.yaml /etc/ep11client/grep11client.yaml
    chmod a+r /etc/ep11client/grep11client.yaml

    mkdir -p /pkcs11
    cp pkcs11-grep11-<platform>.so.<version> /pkcs11/pkcs11-grep11.so
    chmod -R a+rwx /pkcs11

    touch /tmp/grep11client.log
    chmod a+rw /tmp/grep11client.log
    ```
    {: codeblock}

## Set up Db2 native encryption
{: #tutorial-db2-encrypt}
{: step}

Now, let's set up Db2 native encryption. To do so, make sure that you have all database administrator privileges.

1. Create the file `/pkcs11/keystore.conf` with the following content:

    ```
    VERSION=1
    PRODUCT_NAME=Other
    ALLOW_KEY_INSERT_WITHOUT_KEYSTORE_BACKUP=true
    LIBRARY=/pkcs11/pkcs11-grep11.so
    SLOT_ID=0
    NEW_OBJECT_TYPE=PRIVATE
    KEYSTORE_STASH=/pkcs11/pkcs11_pw.sth
    ```
    {: codeblock}

2. Run the following commands as `root` to update ownership and permissions of file `/pkcs11/keystore.conf`:

    ```
    chown -R db2inst1:db2iadm1 /pkcs11/keystore.conf
    chmod ug+rw /pkcs11/keystore.conf
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3. To create a password stash file, run the following commands and replace <normal_user_api_key> by the API key of the normal user that you created.

    ```
    su - db2inst1
    db2credman -stash -password "<normal_user_api_key>" -to /pkcs11/pkcs11_pw.sth
    ```
    {: codeblock}

4. To update the Db2 configuration, run the following command as user `db2inst1`:

    ```
    db2 update dbm cfg using keystore_location /pkcs11/keystore.conf  keystore_type pkcs11
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5. To set the environment variable `DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE`, run the following commands as user `db2inst1` and restart DB2:

    ```
    db2 terminate
    db2stop
    export DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE=HMAC
    db2start
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    You need to specify the environment variable `DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE=HMAC` before you start Db2. If you use Db2 on Windows, you need to set the Db2 profile variable by using the following command:
    {: note}

    ```
    db2set -g DB2_DEK_MAC_TYPE=HMAC
    ```
    {: codeblock}

6. To create an encrypted database, run the following commands:

    ```
    db2 create db cryptdb1 encrypt
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    This command prints the following information:

    ```
    DB20000I  The CREATE DATABASE command completed successfully.
    ```
    {: screen}

7. To test the encrypted database, run the following commands:

    ```
    db2 connect to cryptdb1
    db2 "create table test (id int not null, data varchar(100))"
    db2 "insert into test values (1, 'This is a secret text')"
    db2 "select * from test"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    This command prints the following information:

    ```
    ID          DATA
    ----------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          1 This is a secret text

    1 record(s) selected.
    ```
    {: screen}
