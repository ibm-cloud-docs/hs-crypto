# Restoring keys
{: #restore-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} to restore a previously deleted key and access the associated data on the cloud.
{: shortdesc}

When a key is deleted, it is moved to a _Destroyed_ state. However, information about the key (such as the metadata) can still be viewed and you have 30 days to restore the key to an _Active_ state. For this reason, a key deletion is considered a _Soft deletion_ where the key still exists but can no longer be used to access the data that is encrypted by the key. This topic describes the process to restore a key and the limitations of the key restoration process.

This soft deletion period, in which a key has been deleted but can still be restored, lasts for 30 days. Between 30 days and 90 days, the key data can still be accessed, but the key can no longer be restored. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, which can occur at any time after 90 days. Purged keys, unlike destroyed keys, are gone forever.

| Time from key deletion | Name of key state | Can view or access key data? | Can restore? |
|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 1 - 30 days            | Destroyed         | Yes                       | Yes          |
| 30 - 90 days             | Destroyed         | Yes                       | No           |
| After 90 days          | Purged (not a key state technically)        | No                        | No           |
{: caption="Table 1. Ties key states to the time from a key's deletion to what actions are possible with the key." caption-side="top"}

Because purged keys are inaccessible and destroyed, there is technically no _Purged_ key state. However, it can be useful to think of _Purged_ as being a state because nonexistence is part of the lifecycle of a key.
{: note}

All root keys and standard keys, whether generated by {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} or imported by you, can be restored.
{: important}

## How do I know whether a key can be restored?
{: #restore-keys-eligibility}

To see whether a destroyed key can be restored:

1. Navigate to your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
2. In the left navigation, make sure you are on the **KMS keys** page.
3. Find the key that you want to restore and make sure that the key is in a **Destroyed** state.
4. Check whether the **Last updated** date is within 30 days. If the key was deleted within the last 30 days, it can be restored. If you attempt to restore a key that is no longer eligible to be restored, you will receive an error.

## Restoring a deleted key with the console
{: #restore-keys-ui}
{: help}
{: support}

If you prefer to restore your key by using a graphical interface, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

Complete the following steps to restore the key:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}.
2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.
3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
4. On the **KMS keys** page, use the **Keys** table to browse the keys in your service.
5. Select the key that you want to restore and click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") to open a list of options for the key.
6. From the options menu, click **Restore key**.
7. Click **Restore key** to confirm the action.

## Restoring a deleted key with the API
{: #restore-keys-api}

Restore a key by making a `POST` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/restore
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-set-up-kms-api).

    To restore a key, you must be assigned a _Manager_ access policy for the instance or key. To learn how IAM roles map to {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} service actions, check out [Service access roles](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-manage-access#service-access-roles).
    {: note}

2. Retrieve the key management API endpoint URL.

    You can get the API endpoint from your provisioned service instance dashboard through **Overview** &gt; **Connect** &gt; **Key management endpoint URL**. Or, you can dynamically [retrieve the API endpoint URL](/apidocs/hs-crypto#getinstance){: external} with an API call. Select the public or private key manage endpoint URL based on your needs.

3. Retrieve the ID of the key that you want to restore.

    You can retrieve the ID for a specified key by making a [list keys API request](/apidocs/hs-crypto#getkeys){: external}, or by viewing your keys in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

4. Run the following `curl` command to restore the key and regain access to the associated data. You must wait 30 seconds after deleting a key before you are able to restore it.

   You cannot restore a key that has an expiration date that is current or in the past.
   {: important}

    ```sh
    curl -X POST \
      "https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/restore" \
      -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>' \
      -H 'bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>' \
      -H 'x-kms-key-ring: <key_ring_ID>'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following table.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

            <strong>Required.</strong> The region abbreviation, such as <code>us-south</code> or <code>eu-de</code>, that represents the geographic area where your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} service instance resides.

            <strong>Required.</strong> Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} access token. Include the full contents of the <code>IAM</code> token, including the Bearer value, in the cURL request.
          </p>
          <p>For more information, see <a href="/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-retrieve-access-token">Retrieving an access token</a>.</p>

        <td>

        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            <strong>Optional.</strong> The unique identifier of the key ring that the key belongs to. If unspecified, {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} will search for the key in every key ring that is associated with the specified instance. Therefore, it is suggested to specify the key ring ID for a more optimized request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: The key ring ID of keys that are created without an <code>x-kms-key-ring</code> header is <code>default</code>.
          </p>

      <caption>
        Table 1. Describes the variables that are needed to restore keys with the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} API.
      </caption>
    </table>

    A successful restore request returns an HTTP `201 Created` response, which indicates that the key was restored to the _Active_ key state and is now available for encrypt and decrypt operations. All attributes and policies that were previously associated with the key are also restored.

    You will have access to data associated with the key as soon as the key is restored.
    {: note}

5. Optional: Verify that the key was restored by retrieving details about the key.

    ```sh
    curl -X GET \
      "https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_id>/metadata" \
      -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>' \
      -H 'bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>' \
      -H 'accept: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Where the `<key_id>` is the ID of the key, the `<instance_ID>` is the name of your instance, and your `<IAM_token>` is your IAM token.

    Review the `state` field in the response body to verify that the key moved to the _Active_ key state. The following JSON output shows the metadata details for an _Active_ key.

    The integer mapping for the _Active_ key state is 1. Key states are based on NIST SP 800-57.
