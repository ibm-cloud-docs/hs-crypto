# Why can't I delete an initialized service instance?

{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

You get an error when you delete an initialized service instance.
{: shortdesc}

You might receive an error similar to the following one:
{: tsSymptoms}

```
FAILED
Error Code: RC-ServiceBrokerErrorResponse
Message: Service Broker returned error status code 409
```
{: screen}

You haven't cleared (zeroized) the initialized service instance before you delete the instance.
{: tsCauses}

The procedure varies depending on the method that you use to initialize the service instance.
{: tsResolve}

-  If you've initialized your service instance through {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Trusted Key Entry (TKE) command-line interface (CLI) plug-in, run the following command before you delete the instance:

    ```
    ibmcloud tke cryptounit-zeroize
    ```
    {: pre}

-  If you've initialized your service instance through the TKE application, in the user interface of the application, select **Imprint mode** &gt; **Zeroize crypto unit**.
