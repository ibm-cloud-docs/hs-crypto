# Connecting to external keystores
{: #connect-external-keystores}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} to connect to external keystores through the user interface (UI), or programmatically with the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key management API.
{: shortdesc}

You can connect to keystores that are external to your service instance on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, or from other cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure Key Vault and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Key Management Service (KMS).

For each external keystore, you are charged $6.25 per hour as base price for {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}}. You can connect to one external keystore at no initial cost, regardless of the type. If additional keystores are needed, you are charged $225 per calendar month for each keystore.Â
