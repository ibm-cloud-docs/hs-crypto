# {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} cloud TKE procedures
{: #tke-procedures}

The purpose of this document is to provide a template with procedures for the secure initialization and management of {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} Enterprise PKCS#11 Hardware Security Modules using Cloud Trusted Key Entry (TKE) and smart cards. The document is intended as a template to be tailored to fit the requirements of your organization.

The management of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} can be subject to internal or external audits. For example, by using smart cards to initialize your service instance, the setup and procedures for initialization and management of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} need to be documented, and evidence needs to be collected during execution of the procedures. Several decisions need to be taken by your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} management team to establish a secure setup and make it operational for a production environment. You need to make most of these decisions beforehand and incorporate into this document.
