# Creating internal keystores
{: #create-internal-keystores}

An internal keystore is a repository that stores the cryptographic keys within your service instance. You can use {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} to create internal keystores through the user interface (UI).
{: shortdesc}


Before you create an internal keystore, keep in mind the following considerations:

- You can create up to five internal keystores to manage your keys for free. 
- To enable cross-region key distribution or specified access permissions, you might want to create additional keystores. For more information about the pricing, see [FAQs: Pricing](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricing). Other currencies are applied based on the region the service instance is provisioned in.
- A managed key can be used for encryption and decryption only after you install it in at least one target keystore. 
- A target keystore can be assigned to only one vault.

### Creating internal KMS keystores
{: #create-internal-kms}


To create an internal KMS keystore through the UI, complete the following steps:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Click **Target keystores** from the navigation to view all the available keystores.
3. To create a keystore, click **Add keystore**.
4. Under **Vault**, select a vault for the keystore for access control, and click **Next**. 

   If you want to assign the keystore to a new vault, click **Create vault**. For more instructions, see [Creating vaults](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-vaults).

5. Under **Keystore type**, select **KMS Keystore** and click **Next**.
6. Under **Keystore properties**, enter a name in **Keystore name**. The keystore name can be of 1 to 100 characters. Optionally, you can add an extended description to your keystore in the **Description** section. And then, click **Next**.
7. Under **Summary**, you can view the summary of the keystore that you create, including the keystore type, the assigned vault, and general properties. 
8. After you confirm the keystore details, click **Create keystore** to create the keystore.

You have successfully created an internal KMS keystore.
