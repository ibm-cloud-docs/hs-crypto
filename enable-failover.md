# Enabling or adding failover crypto units after you provision a service instance
{: #enable-add-failover}

Failover crypto units back up the operational crypto units and keystores in another region. If a regional disaster occurs, you can use failover crypto units to automatically restore your data, which can reduce the downtime and data loss. You can either enable failover crypto unit [when you provision a service instance](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-provision) or after you provision a service instance. This topic guides you through enabling or adding failover crypto units after you provision a service instance.
{: shortdesc}

## Enabling or adding failover crypto units with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI
{: #enable-add-failover-cli}

If you have a service instance in the `us-south` or `us-east` region, you can enable failover crypto units for your instance with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Trusted Key Entry (TKE) CLI plug-in. If failover crypto units are already assigned to your service instance, you can still add extra ones.

You can specify a total number of failover crypto units that is equal to or less than the number of operational crypto units. However, to meet high availability, at least two failover crypto units need to be assigned. Failover crypto units are also charged. For the detailed pricing information, see [FAQs: Pricing](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricing).
{: tip}

1. Check and make sure that you install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) and the latest TKE CLI plug-in with the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud plugin install tke
    ```
    {: pre}

    If you have installed the TKE CLI plug-in, make sure to update your plug-in to the latest version with the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud plugin update tke
    ```
    {: pre}

2. To enable or add failover crypto units, run the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud tke failover-enable
    ```
    {: pre}

    Before you can run this command, make sure that you select all the crypto units for the target instance by using the `ibmcloud tke cryptounit-add` command.
    {: note}

    This command walks you through the procedure to enable or add failover crypto units. Follow the prompts to complete the following steps:

    1. Enter the total number of failover crypto units that you want to assign to your service instance.

        For a service instance with 3 operational crypto units, specify 2 or 3 failover crypto units. For a service instance with 2 operational crypto units, specify 2 failover crypto units.

        The following output is a sample display:

        ```
        You currently have 0 failover crypto unit(s) for the selected instance 00000a09-0563-4e00-b259-06a4edfc4cba
        Since you have 2 operational crypto units for this instance, you can have up to 2 failover crypto units
        Enter the total number of failover crypto units you would like (max 2):
        > 2

        You will now have 2 failover crypto units. This will affect your billing. For more information, see https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-faq-pricing

        Would you like to continue? [y/n]:
        > y
        ```
        {: screen}

        If your instance already has a certain number of failover crypto units assigned, you can also use this command and follow the same procedure to add more failover crypto units.
        {: tip}

    2. Type `y` to confirm the action. The failover crypto units are assigned in the target failover region.

        Failover crypto units are now available in `us-south` and `us-east`. The two regions are the target failover regions of each other. For example, if your instance is located in `us-south`, the failover region for your instance is `us-east`.

        The following output is a sample display:

        ```
        Instance 00000a09-0563-4e00-b259-06a4edfc4cba targetting backup region us-south
        2 failover crypto units have been assigned.

        2                 true       OPERATIONAL    [us-east].[AZ2-CS2].[02].[03]
        3                 true       RECOVERY       [us-east].[AZ2-CS4].[03].[06]
        4                 true       RECOVERY       [us-south].[AZ3-CS2].[03].[20]
        5                 false      FAILOVER       [us-south].[AZ2-CS2].[03].[04]
        6                 false      FAILOVER       [us-south].[AZ3-CS3].[01].[07]

        Note: all operational crypto units in a service instance must be configured the same.
        Use 'ibmcloud tke cryptounit-compare' to check how crypto units are configured.
        You should initialize your failover crypto units now to be prepared for a failover event.
        ```
        {: screen}

3. Initialize failover crypto units by using the same master key for the operational crypto units initialization and the same initialization approach:

    - [Initializing service instances with smart cards and the Management Utilities](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm-management-utilities)
    - [Initializing service instances by using key part files](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm)
    - [Initializing service instances by using recovery crypto units](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm-recovery-crypto-unit)

    You need to initialize failover crypto units before you use them for a regional disaster recovery. It is suggested you initialize the failover crypto units right after you enable them for your service instance.

If a regional disaster occurs, you can use failover crypto units for automatic data restoration. For more information, see [Cross-region disaster recovery](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-ha-dr#cross-region-disaster-recovery) and [Restoring your data from another region](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-restore-data).
