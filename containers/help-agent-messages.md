# Agent messages

The following list describes the messages that are issued by the {{site.data.keyword.uko_short}} Agent. The messages are written to the SYSOUT DD name for the started task. Selected messages are also written to the system log as WTO messages, usable for automated operation. The WTO messages are issued with routing codes 2, 9 and 11.

The message number followed by 'I' signifies an informational message, 'E' signifies an error message and 'W' signifies a warning message.

| Message ID | Message | Description | 
|-----|-----|-----|
| KMG001I | {{site.data.keyword.ekmf_short}} Agent initialization has completed. | This is a WTO message.<br> When this message is issued, the initialization of the Agent started task is completed. |
| KMG002E | {{site.data.keyword.ekmf_short}} Agent abnormal termination. | This is a WTO message.<br> This message is issued when an error has occurred during initialization of the Agent started task, or an unrecoverable error has occurred after initialization. Other messages may be issued describing the actual error. Inspect the system log and the SYSOUT for the Agent started task to retrieve additional information. |
| KMG003E | Failure to access TSSPARAM Db2 table.<br>SQL Code: xx. SQLCA Data Structure: xxxxxx. | The SQL error code is described in the manual 'Messages and codes' for DB2.<br> Typical errors are bind errors and access to the Db2 plan/package errors. |
| KMG004I | {{site.data.keyword.ekmf_short}} Agent termination due to DB2 termination. | This is an expected message when Db2 stops. Restart the Agent again when Db2 is available. |
| KMG007E | TCP/IP Error. Socket Function: xxxxxx. Socket Error: xx. | The socket function is the sub-function to the z/OS TCP/IP callable service EZASOKET. A description of the socket error (xx) can be found in the [Sockets return codes documentation of the z/OS Communications Server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=errnos-sockets-return-codes). The socket error corresponds to the error number (errno) from the documentation. The socket error '48', address and TCP/IP port in use, may occur when the Agent is stopped and started within a short interval (0 - 15 seconds). Wait some seconds before restarting the task. |
| KMG008W | TCP/IP Time-out on reading data from client. | An incomplete request has been received from a client. This message will, for example, occur if a client is sending data to the Agent, but is not using the EKMF proprietary communication protocol correctly.

| KMG010W | Invalid transaction - Length not numeric. | This message will, for example, occur if a client is sending data to the Agent, but is not using the EKMF proprietary communication protocol correctly. This message could indicate an unauthorized attempt to access the Agent. |
| KMG011W | Length too short/long. Length: xxxx | A request from a client is received. The length of the request is either too short or too long for the EKMF proprietary communication protocol.<br> This message could indicate an unauthorized attempt to access the host. |
| KMG012W | TCP/IP Time-out on reading data from client. | An incomplete request has been received from a client. This message will, for example, occur if a client sends data to the Agent; but is not using the EKMF proprietary communication protocol, or a {{site.data.keyword.uko_short}} client has abruptly ended.<br> This message could indicate an unauthorized attempt to access the host. |
| KMG013W | TCP/IP connection closed by client. | Could be the {{site.data.keyword.uko_short}} client abruptly ending, or some network layer stopping the connection. |
