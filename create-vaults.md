# Creating vaults
{: #create-vaults}

A vault is a single repository that controls a user's or an access group's access to managed keys and target keystores through {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM). You can create vaults in {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} through the user interface (UI), or programmatically with the {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} API.
{: shortdesc}


{{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} is a limited available feature for customer accounts with special approvals. If you canâ€™t find the {{site.data.keyword.uko_full_notm}} pricing plan when you provision a service instance, it means the plan is not currently available to you. To find more information, contact the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Sales team.

For more information about granting access, see [Granting access to vaults](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grant-access-vaults).


## Creating vaults through the UI
{: #create-vaults-ui}

To create a vault through the UI, complete the following steps through the **Vaults** page. Optionally, you can create a vault when you [create a managed key](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-managed-keys) or [add a keystore](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-internal-keystores).

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Click **Vaults** from the navigation to view all the available vaults.
3. To create a vault, click **Create vault**.
4. Enter a name in **Vault name**. The vault name can be of 1 to 100 characters. Optionally, you can add an extended description to your vault in the **Description** section.
5. Click **Create vault** to confirm.

You have successfully created a vault.
