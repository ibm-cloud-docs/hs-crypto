# Creating vaults
{: #create-vaults}

## Creating vaults through the UI
{: #create-vaults-ui}

To create a vault through the UI, complete the following steps:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Click **Vaults** on the left navigation pane to view all the available vaults.
3. To create a new vault, click **Create vault.**
4. Enter a **Vault name** of 1 to 100 characters in length. Optionally, you can add an extended description to your vault.
6. Click **Create vault** to confirm.


You can also create a new vault when you [create a new key](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-internal-keys) or [add a new keystore](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-create-internal-keystores).
