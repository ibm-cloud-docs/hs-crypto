# Purging keys manually
{: #purge-keys}

A deleted key becomes purged automatically after 90 days of the deletion. If you want to purge a key before it gets automatically purged, make sure that you are assigned the _KMS Key Purge_ role for your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance. A key can be purged manually only after it is deleted for 4 hours.
{: shortdesc}

Before you purge keys, make sure that you understand [the concept of deleting and purging keys](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-delete-purge-keys) and review the [considerations](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-delete-purge-keys#delete-purge-keys-considerations).

To manually purge a key, you need to be assigned the _KMS Key Purge_ role. Even a _Manager_ cannot purge a key. For more information about service access roles, see [IAM service access roles](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-manage-access#service-access-roles).
{: important}

## Purging keys in the console
{: #purge-keys-gui}

If you prefer to purging a key by using a graphical interface, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console by completing the following steps:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.
3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
4. On the **KMS keys** page, use the **Keys** table to browse the keys in your service.
5. Select the key that you want to purge and make sure that the state is _Destroyed_. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") to open a list of options for the key.
6. From the options menu, click **Purge key**.
7. Check the box to confirm the action and click **Purge key**.

You are not able to purge a key if you perform the purging action in 4 hours after you delete the key.

## Purging keys with the API
{: #purge-keys-api}

You can purge a deleted key by making a `DELETE` call to the following endpoint:

```
https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/purge
```

1. [Retrieve your service and authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-set-up-kms-api).
2. Retrieve the ID of the key that you want to delete.

    You can find the ID for a key in your service instance by [retrieving a list of your keys](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-view-keys), or by accessing the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

3. Run the following cURL command to permanently delete the key and the contents.

    ```sh
    curl -X DELETE \
      "https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/purge" \
      -H "authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>" \
      -H "bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>" \
      -H "x-kms-key-ring: <key_ring_ID>" \
      -H "prefer: <return_preference>"
    ```

    Replace the variables in the example request according to the following table.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Variable</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><varname>region</varname></td>
        <td><strong>Required.</strong> The region abbreviation, such as <code>us-south</code> or <code>au-syd</code>, that represents the geographic area where your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance resides. For more information, see <a href="/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-regions#service-endpoints">Regional service endpoints</a>.</td>
      </tr>

        <td><strong>Required.</strong> Your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} access token. Include the full contents of the <code>IAM</code> token, including the Bearer value, in the cURL request.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><varname>instance_ID</varname></td>

        <td>
          <p>
            <strong>Optional.</strong> The unique identifier of the key ring that the key belongs to. If it is not specified, {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} searches for the key in every key ring that is associated with the specified instance. Therefore, it is suggested to specify the key ring ID for a more optimized request.
          </p>
          <p>
          The key ring ID of keys that are created without an <code>x-kms-key-ring</code> header is <code>default</code>.
          </p>

        <td><p>A header that alters server behavior for <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> operations.</p><p>When you set the <em>return_preference</em> variable to <code>return=minimal</code>, the service returns a successful deletion response.

      </tr>
      <caption>Table 1. Describes the variables that are needed to purge keys with the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key management service API.</caption>
    </table>

    If the `return_preference` variable is set to `return=representation`, the details of the `DELETE` request are returned in the response entity-body.

    The following JSON object shows a sample returned value.
